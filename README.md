Part C :
I used the Random Forest Algorithm for the Regression Problem. The reason is that it is very accurate and powerful,compared to other algorithms. I first tried the Multiple Regression method, which gave accuracy about 70%, but with Random Forest, the accuracy is about 80% , which is a very good thing for a ML problem.Also, since the dataset is sufficiently large, Random Forest works suitably well for large datasets. Also, compared to Decision Trees, Random Forest reduces overfitting problem.
When building a Random Forest model, we can control the number/proportion of features that are used to find the best split for each node. This process allows the creation of less correlated trees and, combined with bootstrap aggregation, produces a Random Forest.
